/*
Level 1: Basic Constructor Practice
Create a class Laptop with a constructor that displays a message "Laptop object created".

Create a class Employee that takes name and salary in the constructor and displays them using a function.

Make a class Rectangle with length and breadth, and constructor should calculate and print area.

Create a class Pen with a default constructor that assigns color as "Blue" and price as 10.

Write a program with class Book that has a constructor with one argument for the title of the book.

Level 2: Parameterized + Copy Constructor
Create a class Mobile with a parameterized constructor to initialize model and price.

Write a class Player with a copy constructor. First object takes data using parameterized constructor, second copies from it.

Create a class Person which stores name and age. Add a method isAdult() that checks if age >= 18.

Make a class Circle which takes radius in constructor and prints circumference and area.

Create class BankAccount with constructor taking account holder name, account number and balance. Use display() function to show data.

Level 3: Constructor Overloading
Create a class Car with:

Default constructor (prints "Default Car")

One parameter constructor (car name)

Two parameter constructor (name + price)

Create a class Movie that stores title and rating using constructor overloading (0, 1 or 2 arguments).

Make class Box with constructor overloading to calculate:

Volume of cube (one argument)

Volume of cuboid (3 arguments)

Level 4: Advanced + Inheritance Constructor
Create class Base and class Derived, show how base class constructor is called when derived object is created.

Create class Student and Marks, where Marks is derived from Student. Pass name and roll number using base constructor.

Make class Date that uses default arguments in constructor. If no date is passed, default to 1/1/2000.

Use constructor to count how many objects are created using a static counter.

Write a program where constructor calls a private function to validate data (e.g., age should not be negative).

Level 5: Mini Projects Using Constructor
Mini Project 1: Student Report Card

Class with name, roll, 3 subject marks.

Constructor takes all input and calculates total + average.

Mini Project 2: Online Order System

Class Order with product name, price, quantity.

Constructor calculates total cost.

Display function shows order summary.

Mini Project 3: Time Class

Create Time class with hour, minute, second.

Constructor should normalize time (e.g., 75 min = 1 hr 15 min).
